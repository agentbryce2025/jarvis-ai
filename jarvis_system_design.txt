JARVIS-LIKE AI SYSTEM DESIGN
===========================

1. CORE TECHNOLOGIES AND PACKAGES
-------------------------------
- LangChain & LangGraph: For orchestrating the overall system workflow
- ChromaDB: For vector storage and semantic search
- Redis: For fast cache and real-time data management
- FastAPI: For API endpoints and system interfaces
- PyTorch: For custom ML model implementations
- Pydantic: For data validation and settings management
- APScheduler: For task scheduling
- OpenAI API: For core language model capabilities
- Whisper: For speech-to-text
- gTTS or ElevenLabs: For text-to-speech
- SQLAlchemy: For structured data storage
- RabbitMQ: For message queue system

2. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
---------------------

A. Memory Subsystem (MemoryCore)
- Uses ChromaDB for embedding-based semantic search
- Redis for short-term memory cache (30-minute window)
- PostgreSQL for structured long-term storage
- Implements memory consolidation from short-term to long-term storage
- Uses LangChain's memory primitives with custom extensions
- Includes automatic memory summarization and pruning

B. Personality System (PersonaEngine)
- YAML-based personality configuration
- Emotional state tracking using a state machine
- Relationship memory tracking
- Personality adaptation based on interaction history
- Default fallback personality with neutral parameters

C. Task Planning Module (TaskManager)
- LangGraph-based workflow engine
- ReAct framework implementation with added reflection
- Multi-step planning with backtracking capability
- Priority queue for task management
- Confidence scoring for task execution
- Integration with memory for context-aware planning

D. System Interface (SystemCore)
- Sandboxed command execution environment
- Regular expression-based command validation
- Allowlist/blocklist system for commands
- Logging and monitoring system
- Error recovery mechanisms

E. Multimodal Handler (InputOutputManager)
- Audio processing pipeline (Whisper)
- Text-to-Speech system (configurable between options)
- Standardized input/output protocol
- Queue-based message handling
- Format conversion utilities

F. Scheduler (TimeManager)
- Timezone-aware scheduling system
- Task priority management
- Conflict resolution for overlapping tasks
- Minimum buffer time enforcement
- Persistent schedule storage

G. Self-Modification Module (CodeEvolver)
- Static code analysis before modifications
- Version control integration (Git)
- Sandboxed testing environment
- Rollback capabilities
- Change validation system

H. Data Integration Bus (DataHub)
- RabbitMQ-based message broker
- Standardized message format
- Comprehensive logging system
- Real-time monitoring
- Data validation layer

3. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
-------------------------
- Sandboxed execution environment
- Input validation at all entry points
- Rate limiting for resource-intensive operations
- Secure storage for sensitive data
- Regular security audits
- Access control system

4. SCALABILITY FEATURES
-----------------------
- Microservices architecture
- Horizontally scalable components
- Load balancing capability
- Distributed memory system
- Caching at multiple levels

5. MONITORING AND MAINTENANCE
----------------------------
- Comprehensive logging system
- Performance metrics collection
- Health check endpoints
- Automated backup system
- Error reporting and analytics

6. FUTURE EXPANSION POINTS
-------------------------
- Plugin system for additional capabilities
- API for external integrations
- Model switching capability
- Additional memory storage backends
- Enhanced multimodal capabilities

This design implements all required features while maintaining a modular, secure, and scalable architecture. The system uses industry-standard tools and frameworks while allowing for future expansions and improvements. The LangGraph integration ensures proper orchestration of all components while maintaining the flexibility needed for a Jarvis-like system.
